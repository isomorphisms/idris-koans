idris-koans
===========

Koans are small lessons on the path to enlightenment.
Fix the broken code you find in each file.
<!-- By fixing the code you will learn more about Idris and functional programming. -->

Within the `Koans` folder you will find the various lessons.
<!-- Each lesson addresses various topics within FP, and also specific to Idris.  -->
Each lesson consists of a series of functions that when passed through the Idris compiler will either: fail to type check, or have the wrong behaviour.
<!-- To pass each lesson each function needs to be completed or fixed so that it type checks, or has deterministic behaviour. -->

The files should be attempted in the following order:

1. 01-Arithmetic.idr
1. 02-Equality.idr
1. 03-Boolean.idr
1. 04-Ranges.idr
1. 05-Lists.idr
1. 06-ListComprehensions.idr

Fix the files, then run e.g. `idris --check 01-Arithmetic.idr`.









Idris Koans is in early development<!-- and so the list of Koans and method of interaction is primitive-->.
